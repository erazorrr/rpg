This is a simple roguelike game I put together in a spare time on my vacation.

## How to launch
Run the appropriate version from the `build` folder.

### Hot to build it yourself
- `npm run build`
- `npm run package`

After that, new executables will be in a `build` folder.

## Backlog
- Items dropped should not destroy items that lay on the current tile
- Add more details to the game map
- Add more monsters
- Add ring items
- Add amulet items
- Add new weapon modifiers (e.g., leach live + anti-leach live)
- Add new monster modifiers (e.g., leach life)
- Monsters' shouting should attract other monsters
- Add idle animations
- Add game save and load
