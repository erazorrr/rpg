# TODO
## Hard
- Add game save and load

## Medium
- Add more details/tiles to the game map
- Add more monster bases
- Chests
- Trader
  - I was thinking about having one on each dungeon level
- Add new weapon modifiers
    - leach live - transfer hp from target to source
    - anti-leach live - spend hp per hit to deal more damage (or have better attributes)
    - knockback
- Add new monster modifiers
    - leach live
    - poisonous
        - add antidote that removes poisonous state

## Easy
- Items dropped should not destroy items that lay on the current tile
- Add ring items
- Add amulet items
- Monsters' shouting should attract other monsters
